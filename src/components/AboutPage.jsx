      <h4>Our Product</h4>
      <p>
        As an ASSPG user (ASSPG-er), you can be rest assured that you will
        receive an industry-leading secured password produced by our AI's
        artificial neural network hybrid-cloud blockchain engine. The generated
        passwords have been tested vigorously -- from regression testing to
        taste testing - we employ the use of cutting-edge technology wherever
        possible. It has been statistically proven that compared to an average

        methods. Once you've been onboarded as an ASSPG-er, you will not only
        receive a lifetime of backend support, but also receive access to our
        Discord server. Take care of your private systems, become an ASSPG-er

      <h4>Our History</h4>
      <p>
        After having our cybersecurity firm being hacked into for the fifth time
        in 3 months, we realized that using the string 'password' as our
        database's password is no longer cutting it. So, we set out on a mission
        to build a password generating service that we would be proud to call
        someone else's. In fact, that's what we did -- we called somebody. We
        reached out to our aforementioned hackers and inquired about their
        process behind their work. By having their perspective, we were able to
        understand the ins-and-outs of today's cybersecurity industry trends. We
        then teamed up to provide a service, levering our synergy as hacker and
        hackee -- they provide consultations on how to better secure our
        systems, and we in turn provide them our users' data. It's a win-win!
