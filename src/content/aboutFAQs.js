    answer:
      "Our lawyers' sister-in-law has informed us to don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone for any reason ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been... ever, for any reason whatsoever.",

    question: "I don't get the joke. Explain, please.",
    answer:
      'Only if you swear that the joke is no less funnier because we need to explain it.',
  },
  {
    question:
      'Ok, I swear that the explanation of the joke does not take away anything from it.',
    answer:
      "Fine. For context, a dictionary attack is a method of bypassing security by systematically using every word in a dictionary as a password. It is important to note that 'aardvark' is one of the first words in the dictionary, making it a very weak password in dictionary attacks. Therefore, it is funny that the whole website revolves around a very poor password choice. (You can laugh now.) Except, here's the kicker -- the \"password generator\" defaults to \"optimizing for reverse dictionary attacks\". That's funny because you are to assume that since dictionary attacks go through dictionary words in order from a to z, a reverse dictionary attack would iterate dictionary words from z to a, which makes a word that starts with an 'a' a \"good password\" since 'aardvark' would be used last. (You should be wheezing at this point.) With the mystery solved, you may now go ahead and explore the absolutely genius parody site for yourself.",
